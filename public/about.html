<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm just starting my exciting journey into the world of web development! I'm currently diving headfirst into a coding course, learning the ropes with Visual Studio Code.</p>

<p>I'm passionate about creating user-friendly and visually appealing web experiences.  I'm particularly interested in collaborating with other developers to bring ideas to life.</p>

<p>This is just the beginning, and I'm eager to learn and grow alongside other passionate individuals. If you're a fellow developer or have a project that needs a web development intern, let's chat!  I'm always looking for opportunities to collaborate and learn.
